# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my **personal portfolio** [website](https://santhanuv.dev). It is built using **Astro**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, and deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.

The portfolio presents my projects, experience, and information as a **software engineer**. It includes a contact form that uses **Cloudflare Turnstile** for verification and **Resend** for sending email notifications through Cloudflare Functions.
